Exercise 85: Compute the Hypotenuse

Write a function that takes the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle as
its parameters. Return the hypotenuse of the triangle, computed using Pythagorean
theorem, as the functionâ€™s result. Include a main program that reads the lengths of
the shorter sides of a right triangle from the user, uses your function to compute the
length of the hypotenuse, and displays the result.

Pythagorean theorem = c2 = a2 + b2
