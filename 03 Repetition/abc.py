# Compute the total due when several items are purchased. The amount payable for cash
# transactions is rounded to the closest nickel because pennies have been phased out in Canada.

#While it is highly unlikely that the number of pennies in a nickel will ever change, it is
#possible (even likely) that we will need to update our program at some point in the future so
#that it rounds to the closest dime. Using constants will make it easier to perform that update
#when it is needed.

# Track the total cost for all of the items
total = 0.00
# Read the price of the first item as a string
line = input("Enter the price of the item (blank to quit): ")
# Continue reading items until a blank line is entered
while line != "":
# Add the cost of the item to the total (after converting it to a floating-point number)
    total = total + float(line)
# Read the cost of the next item
    line = input("Enter the price of the item (blank to quit): ")
# Display the exact total payable
print("The exact amount payable is %.02f" % total)
# Compute the number of pennies that would be left if the total was paid using nickels
